# Light Switch Light Sensor

The Light Switch Light Sensor, or LSLS for short, is designed to work with a Light Switch Activator to automatically turn on your lights depending on how bright or dim it currently is. I designed it to be simple and intuitive, with its main function being an additional interface or sensor to the Light Switch Activator. However, it works as a standalone by sending you an email when it reaches a specific point in brightness.

This project engages the data security topics we discussed in class by collecting and sending sensitive data. If hackers manage to access this data and the device is placed indoors, they can easily tell when the house's occupants are asleep or away if the light sensor records dim brightness. This can lead to malicious activity such as physical burglary, creepy tracking or unethical selling of data to companies.
